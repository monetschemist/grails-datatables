# embrow - Sample Employee Browser for Grails and jQuery DataTables

The DataTables plugin for jQuery is so cool!!! But all the documentation gives PHP examples... hmmm.  And, the examples are too simple; they don't show how to deal with lookup tables, in particular.  This project aims to correct that, by elaborating the DataTables employee example a bit with some lookup tables, and by hosting it in Grails.

## Getting Started

Get this repository.  Install the latest Java 8 (might work with newer Javas, not tested as of 2018/08/05).  Install the current SDKMAN, available at https://sdkman.io.  Use SDKMAN to install the latest Groovy and Grails.  You're good to go!

More documentation and explanation will be available before the end of 2018 on [https://www.opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/18/9/using-grails-jquery-and-datatables)
